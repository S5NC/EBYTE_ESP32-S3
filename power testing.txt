sniporbob's testing of SX1262 CONFIGURED Output Power Level (implicit dBm) vs E22-900M30S Output Power (dBm) using SIGLENT SA
The SX1262 is the chip used inside the E22-900M30S, and the thing which is communicated with using SPI.
Maximum possible SX1262 output power configuration is +22 dBm, values above this are clamped by the firmware (and possibly by the SX1262 itself?)
SX1262 can be configured to output power levels of 0 and below, but there were not tested (very limited applications which use sub 10mW output power, and in cases where output above +22 dBm is not needed, the E22-900M30S 1W module can be swapped for another less expensive one), SX1262's lowest output value is -9 dBm if high power PA is selected, and -17 dBm if low power PA is selected, values can be set in increments of 1
